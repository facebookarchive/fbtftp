        `ServerStats` represents a digest of what happened during the server's
        lifetime.

        This class exposes a counter interface with get/set/reset methods and
        an atomic get-and-reset.

        An instance of this class is passed to a periodic function that is
        executed by a background thread inside the `BaseServer` object.
        See `stats_callback` in the `BaseServer` constructor.

        If you use it in a metric publishing callback, remember to use atomic
        operations and to reset the counters to have a fresh start. E.g. see
        `get_and_reset_all_counters'.
